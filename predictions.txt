Problem 5.

We predict the utilities will be more or less a gradient based on the columns. For the actual numbers, we can look at the likely path that would be taken to a goal state. For the squares on the far left, they are about 20 squares away from a terminal 1 state, meaning their utility would be about 1-20(.04) = .2. This is in an ideal case, since there is a change it would take longer, we can reduce this down to about .1 or .05. The square on the far left might get down into the negatives (-0.1) and the square right next to the -1 would probably be around -0.2. In the middle, there are about 10 squares to a terminal state, meaning the ideal utility is around 1-10(-0.4) = .6, reduced to .5 or .4. For states very close to the terminal 1s, we think it will be similar to the 4x3 world, with utilities around .8.
